## "Arma Humanitas"

We fight totalitarianism by helping groups of any size organize.
We achieve this by crafting tools for data driven community management and community enforced transparency.
Our 1st product is an open-source Discord bot for communities to stop rewarding freeloaders. 
It provides better analytics for community managers and makes it simple to share stats with their community.

## Contribution tracker bot

Our 1st open-source product. Made for Discord community managers.
