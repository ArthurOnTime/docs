## "Arma Humanitas"

We believe in empowering the freedom of associations to counter totalitarianism. 
We empower the freedom of association by crafting tools for data driven community organization and community enforced transparency.
Our 1st product is an open-source Discord bot for communities to stop rewarding freeloaders. 
It provides better analytics for community managers and makes it simple to share stats with their community.
